				to the many advantages it offers such as durability, security, faultless structure, environment-friendly,
				flexibility, and most importantly affordability. Get you dream residential steel homes in a very short
				time.
				<a href="https://karmod.com/en/">Karmod's</a> innovative designs reduce costs. Building a steel frame
				home
				is a wonderful investment! Building
				with
				our steel framed home systems you are getting superior strength, better energy efficiency, less
				maintenance,
				a
				non-combustible material, and the use of a renewable green product in your home's main frame support
				system.
				This alone makes it the preferred material to build for your family to deter maintenance cost and have
				that
				added protection in case of threatening weather or fire situations. Metal building homes will never be
				compromised by termites or mold, therefore; there's no need to use dangerous chemicals to prevent such,
				eliminating excessive maintenance costs. Prefab steel homes also offer high energy efficiency when
				designed
				by
				our engineering team which maximizes utility bill savings. Over 60% of our steel is made from discarded
				steel
				products, so you can rest easy knowing you are also making a green choice by building a prefab steel
				frame
				home
				produced by Steel Structures and our knowledgeable steel engineers.

			<h2>Steel Building - A Smart Investment</h2>
			<p>
				One of the biggest advantages of our LSF structures is their ability to be manufactured offsite. This
				allows
				the next stage of construction to begin much sooner, saving onsite labor and assembly time and reducing
				overall
				costs. Light steel frame system also ensures the structure is manufactured to a superior quality due to
				our
				strictly factory-controlled processes allowing only products that meet our high standards to pass through
				our
				quality control stage.

				Light-Gauge Steel framing systems decrease the human involvement in that it negates any faults as much as
				possible. Construction time on site also minimizes the levels of mistakes that can happen with
				conventional
				buildings as all processes are handled under strictly controlled conditions during all manufacturing and
				production stages. These and other reasons make the light gauge steel system option, far superior to that
				of
				traditional building construction. Structural Steel Frames are no longer exclusively used only for
				skyscrapers
				and large commercial buildings, This system is also used to build modern, attractive houses and
				commercial
				buildings with many benefits over conventional methods of construction
